[dd/mm/yy] - A3:
	- Extended railway across multiple sections of map.
	- Closed off the garage door exit from the Red stage 3 cut-through.
	- Changed the layout of the Red stage 2 spawn room.
	- Refined other areas of minor feedback from the previous playtest.
	- Re-structured various areas around the final point, hopefully making flanking more viable and giving Blue a better forward hold.
	- Added some rocks at stage 1 to help break sightlines a little.
